We'll use these pieces as a pattern to cut fur later. `),t(),a(39,"img",10),i(40,"p"),e(41,' I had a personal goal of designing the interior to be completely removable everywhere that my head physically touched for easier cleaning. I used quarter-sized disk magnets on the inside of the base, paired with matching magnets inside of spandex covered foam "cups" that wrap around the sides and back of your head.

The inner ear is just black felt to give a sense of depth and the foam lobes are wrapped in more fur which is hot glued on. After the ears are in place, I added select areas of thin 1/4" foam to the interior of the fur mask.

These are places like dimples, the underside of cheeks, the furled eyebrow/nose bridge, etc.. Anywhere with significant concave curves. I drilled very small holes in those spots, stretched the fur mask over the base, then pushed sewing needles through the holes and mask to create a loop of thread.
