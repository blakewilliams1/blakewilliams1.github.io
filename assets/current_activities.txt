riding my motorcycle to the bottom of South America
keying the batmobile
achieving enlightenment for fun and profit
dilly-dallying
googling a rare software bug
in the prime of my existence
cooked
studying for graduate school
trying my best! :)
camping in my tent, somewhere in South America 
trying to use the Bene Gesserit voice from Dune to get a free subway sandwich 
thinking of funny things to write here
pretending I've got it all figured out 
intentionally forgetting how to read
touching grass
about 12 raccoons inside a trenchcoat
