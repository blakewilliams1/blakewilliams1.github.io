One such camp is Brul\xE9e, a circus arts camp. The camp is a cube built out of the gigantic scaffolding that make up the aisles at Costco. In the center is a stage with performance artists rotating through. A majority of the acts were partner gymnastics with some element of fire juggling involved.

Ahead of you there is one or several dim lights on the horizon, and you decide to venture deeper into the desert to see what they are, like an angler fish drawing in curious creatures from the darkness. The warm wind is moderately blowing, kicking up a slow rolling cloud of dust everywhere you go and as you get closer to the light source you see it's a mobile converted bus, parked like an oasis in vast nothingness around you. You knock on the door with a smile, and are greeted with warm smiles in return. The interior is wooden paneled and decorated to make you feel like you're below deck on a wooden ship.

"),t(),a(97,"img",32),i(98,"p"),e(99," Out in deep playa, there was a train station set up leading to nowhere. The rails emerged out of the desert and receded back into it shortly after.

The artists must have set up microphones around train tracks while a train was passing because the sound was shockingly realistic. "),t(),i(100,"p"),e(101," Inside the building was a waiting room and small operator room with an old MS-DOS terminal covered in to-do notes and memos about the train.

As you approach it, the crowds energy completely changes and everything becomes silent and pensive. The air practically weighs heavily in your lungs with how somber the mood is inside. The central room is surrounded by a circular ring-shaped pathway with numerous alcoves to maximize the surface area on the walls. Even still, the walls are filled to the brim with stapled on letters addressed to the deceased, memorial posters, sharpie-d notes onto the walls, and sentimental memorabilia. Groups of people sit in silence together in the alcoves and central room in silence, many silently crying. The structure is designed to be burned down the day after the man burns, as a cathartic release. I felt conflicted being in the temple; I had no grief in my heart that merited release.
