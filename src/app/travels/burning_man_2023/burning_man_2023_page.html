  <h2>Thursday</h2>
  <p>
    I came late to the party because of work (mistake to have done that) and since I was going to be meeting a lot of
    new camp mates I wanted to make an impression so I bought sushi in Reno and kept it on ice for the last hour drive
    out to the playa.

    This next image is one of my favorite pictures of the entire burn, because it's very representative of the kind of thing
    you experience at night when biking through deep playa. Riding off into the dark while high, you hear the distant
    thumping of several sound camps playing music in the distance. Ahead of you there is one or several dim lights on
    the horizon, and you decide to venture deeper into the desert to see what they are, like an angler fish drawing in
    curious creatures from the darkness. The warm wind is moderately blowing, kicking up a slow rolling cloud of dust
    everywhere you go and as you get closer to the light source you see it's a mobile converted bus, parked like an
    oasis in vast nothingness around you. You knock on the door with a smile, and are greated with warm smiles in
    return. The interior is wooden paneled and decorated to make you feel like you're below deck on a wooden ship.

    This peice was one of my favorites, it was a giant bison made of driftwood with a guiding lantern the illuminated
    the night from a distance, and once you approached it there would be a ladder to climb up onto a porch alongside
    the torso. You could enter into the torso through a decaying wooden door, and inside there was an immaculately done
    up cottage living room, complete with a rocking chair, wood-burning cast iron fireplace, rugs, and a small
    chandelier at head level. I regret not getting more pictures of this one!

    I visited the temple, but didn't take any pictures besides this one from the outside. As you approach it, the crowds
    energy completely changes and everything becomes silent and pensive. The air practically weighs heavily in your lungs
    with how somber the mood is inside. The central room is surrounded by a circular ring-shaped pathway with numerous
    alcoves to maximize the surface area on the walls. Even still, the walls are filled to the brim with stapled on
    letters addressed to the deceased, memorial posters, sharpied notes onto the walls, and sentimental memorabilia.
    Groups of people sit in silence together in the alcoves and central room in silence, many silently crying. The structure
    is designed to be burned down the day after the man burns, as a cathartic release. I felt conflicted being in the
    temple; I had no grief in my heart that merited release. I felt with each letter or open note I saw, I was intruding
    deeply into some stranger's life.

    Towards one of the very farthest corners of the outer play, I saw the very faintest of yellow lights flickering like
    a candle in the far distance. It was so small that I thought it might be someone's distant headlamp but as it
    remained motionless I decided to ride towards it. As I got closer, I saw it surrounded by a large dim red glow, and
    happening upon it I found it was a giant replica of the Fat Man atom bomb acting as a massive combo space heater and
    sausage grill! It was a father-son duo that built it and hauled it out there. A dozen people were around it, how could
    I have missed this after so much time exploring out here?

    Watching the man burn was incredible. Not only was it by far the largest bonfire I'd ever seen by far, but it had
    legitimately the best fireworks show I've ever seen in my life. It's not by video, but
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHDV_VB6dkI" target="_blank">here's a recording of it</a>. I vividly
    remember being told by friends to never look away from the man once the official start time elapses, because there
    would be a large explosion to signal the start of the man burning. That explosion came after the fireworks, and it
    was this perfectly round ball of light radiant heat you could feel on your face from a quarter mile away that
    materialized out of nowhere in an instant. The audible <b>POP!</b> of it hits you delayed and it really drives home
    the size of the pyrotechnics going on.

    As the man and structure he's on burns down to a smoldering hill and the radiant heat begins to border on being
    tolerable, the guards allow everyone to approach. A large portion of people begin stripping off their clothes and
    start to run in a massive circle around the bonfire. I joined in and followed the crowd as it raced around, the heat
    unbelievably hot. The pile was square in shape and rounding the corners was so hot at times you'd be jumping over
    the section and poeple would be on the sidelines with spray bottles of water to help cool you off. I set me clothes
    on the ground, but completely lost track of them by the time I was ready to get dressed again and wandered naked for
    15 minutes through the hundreds of side lined crowd looking for my clothes pile. Being naked around strangers you'll
    never see again wasn't as big an issue as how cold it was getting without direct line of sight to the bonfire.

    While the ferver of the the main burn was slowing down, all the art cars had been encircling the area, all on full
    display for the main night, car after car lined up pouring out music and light.
