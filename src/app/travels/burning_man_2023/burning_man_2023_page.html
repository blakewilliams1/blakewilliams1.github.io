  <h2>Thursday</h2>
  <p>
    I came late to the party because of work (mistake to have done that) and since I was going to be meeting a lot of
    new camp mates I wanted to make an impression so I bought sushi in Reno and kept it on ice for the last hour drive
    out to the playa.

    This peice was one of my favorites, it was a giant bison made of driftwood with a guiding lantern the illuminated
    the night from a distance, and once you approached it there would be a ladder to climb up onto a porch alongside
    the torso. You could enter into the torso through a decaying wooden door, and inside there was an immaculately done
    up cottage living room, complete with a rocking chair, wood-burning cast iron fireplace, rugs, and a small
    chandelier at head level. I regret not getting more pictures of this one!

    Watching the man burn was incredible. Not only was it by far the largest bonfire I'd ever seen by far, but it had
    legitimately the best fireworks show I've ever seen in my life. It's not by video, but
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHDV_VB6dkI" target="_blank">here's a recording of it</a>. I vividly
    remember being told by friends to never look away from the man once the official start time elapses, because there
    would be a large explosion to signal the start of the man burning. That explosion came after the fireworks, and it
    was this perfectly round ball of light radiant heat you could feel on your face from a quarter mile away that
    materialized out of nowhere in an instant. The audible <b>POP!</b> of it hits you delayed and it really drives home
    the size of the pyrotechnics going on.
