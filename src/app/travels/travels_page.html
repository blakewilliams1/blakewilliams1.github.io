      I'm riding my motorcycle on the largest expedition I've ever done; a one year
      ride from California to the very bottom of South America. I spend several years learning spanish solo
      and in immersion programs in Central America, as well as left my job in order to properly
      accomplish this one.

        I decided to get tattoos from an artist living in Poland and figured if I'm paying for the flights to Europe,
        I might as well make a larger trip out of it if I'm already going that far? My trip was Netherlands -> Germany
        -> Poland -> Czech Republic

      For many years I hadn't thought much about Burning Man; I'd met a handful of people that made
      me think most burners were self-interested hippies trying to get instagram pictures and not much
      else. A few key experiences made me have second thoughts on that impression, and when I was offered
      a spot at a camp I took it and went to see what the hype was about.

      I solo climbed Mt. Shasta over 2 days, ascending the Avalanche Gulch route, and took my snowboarding gear with me
      to back-country snowboard down after reaching the summit.

        the Yukon, then rode the Dempster Highway to the town of Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories of Canada to see the

      After several years of playing the permit lottery, I finally found luck in daily lotteries and had the chance to
      summit Half Dome. I got the email for a permit valid for the next morning so after work I packed my car, drove out
      to Yosemite in the evening, slept in my car the best I could, then started the hike about an hour before sunrise.

        I rode my motorcycle long the original overland trail that is the Pony Express, from Sacramento to
        Salt Lake City Utah. This covered ~700 miles of dirt road and many stops along the way at historic
        stations used by the original Pony Express business.
