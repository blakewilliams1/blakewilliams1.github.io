    This July, I'm planning to ride my motorcycle on the largest expedition I've ever done; a 6 month
    ride from California to the very bottom of South America. I left my job in order to properly
    accomplish this one.

    After many years of deliberating what tattoos to get first I finally decided on visiting an artist
    in Poland, so why not make a trip out of it if I'm already going that far? My trip was Netherlands
    -> Germany -> Poland -> Czech Republic

  <p>
    For many years I hadn't thought much about Burning Man; I'd met a handful of people that made
    me think most burners were self-interested hippies trying to get instagram pictures and not much
    else. A few key experiences made me have second thoughts on that impression, and when I was offered
    a spot at a camp I took it and went to see what the hype was about.

    I solo climbed Mt. Shasta over 2 days, ascenting the Avalanche Gulch route and taking my snowboarding gear with me

      In the early spring of 2023 I solo traveled to Mauritania, west Africa to hike through a portion

      I rode my motorcycle from the SF Bay Area up the California coast, Orgeon coast, Washington
      coast, took a ferry to Vancouver island, took another ferry back to Prince Rupert BC, rode to
      the Yukon, then rode the Dempster Highway to the town of Tuktoyaktuk, NWT Canada to see the
      Arctic Ocean.

    <p>
      I rode my motorcycle long the original overland trail that is the Pony Express, from Sacramento to
      Salt Lake City Utah. This covered ~700 miles of dirt road and many stops along the way at historic
      stations used by the original Pony Express business.
