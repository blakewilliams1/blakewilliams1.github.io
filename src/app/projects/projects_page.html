  <p>
    I like the tap-to-pay features of smart watches, but don't want a fully featured smart watch
    that needs to be recharged every single day to work. Now that contactless payment via NFC
    chips is much more common, I wanted to make my own ultra lightweight contactless payment watch.
    I attempted to make it with favorite cheap digital watch - the Casio A168WEM, a custom NFC
    antenna I had printed on a flex PCB from Oshpark, and a NFC chip that I got by melting down
    one of my credit cards in acetone.<br>
    Outside of the watch, the NFC chip and custom antenna worked like a charm!! However, I get
    too much parasitic capacitance or other inteference when nestled in the digital watch case.
    I'll need to figure this out to solve it and call it done.

    A road bike is to a mounntain bike, as a skateboard is to a mountainboard. Their height of popularity
    was in the early 2000's along with the X-games. Some compare it to the sensation of snowboarding,
    but like most analogies it's a little bit of a stetch.<br>
    This was a major project where I learned about good battery design, some machining skills, and a
    lot of patience.

  <p>
    Wanting to make another watch after finishing the nixie tube watch, I decided to try working with
    some <a href="https://www.industrialalchemy.org/articleview.php?item=750">retro dot matrix dipslays</a>.
    These are REALLY neet to look at if you can get your hands on them. They're very early gallium-phosphate
    LEDS; the only application I've seen them used in are for commercial airplane cockpit displays. Because
    these were used in avionics, they are ceramic case-bodies and the top layer is saphire. I was able to
    write <a href="https://github.com/blakewilliams1/dot-matrix-watch-2">these display drivers</a> for it
    based on <a href="http://www.datasheetspdf.com/pdf-down/H/D/S/HDSP2000_Hewlett-Packard.pdf">these xerox scans</a>
    of old datasheets from the 1970's.

    <mat-card-title>Nixie Tube Wrist Watch</mat-card-title>
    <mat-card-subtitle>Check the divergence!</mat-card-subtitle>
  </mat-card-header>
  <p>
    This was one of my first exposures to hardware design beyond simple arudino proto boards that
    drove small motors or read from simple sensors. I heavily based my schematic off of an existing
    one I found online by <a href="http://www.cathodecorner.com/nixiewatch/firmware/firmware.html">David Forbes</a>.
    The main difference is that mine uses four IN-17 nixie tubes instead of just two B5870L tubes.
    I accounted for this doubling of tubes by swapping out his PIC18LF22SS with an atmega324pb, which
    has around 30-ish GPIO pins. I directly drove every filament in use with a GPIO pin and a darlington
    transistor. As this was my first 'major' hardware project, I didn't want to deal with extra IC
    components like a serial to parallel shift register to complicate it any more.
