        An old wall of flip dots at work fell into disrepair, and the panels were being parted out.
        I was able to snag a few of them and recreate the wall in a miniature version! It even uses
        a depth camera to show your silhouette in real time as you move in front of it like the original.

        The altimeter is a must have instrument every time you go skydiving, so why not make it cool?
        I savaged several <a href="https://www.industrialalchemy.org/storearticleview.php?item=113" target="_blank">KW-105AL diplays</a>
        from avionics equipment an the good ol' BMP280 barometer to make an altimeter with.<br>
        Finding even 4 of these displays <i>anywhere</i> online literally took months of scouring.

        I like the tap-to-pay features of smart watches, but don't want a fully featured smart watch
        that needs to be recharged every single day to work. Now that contactless payment via NFC
        chips is much more common, I wanted to make my own ultra lightweight contactless payment watch.
        I attempted to make it with favorite cheap digital watch - the Casio A168WEM, a custom NFC
        antenna I had printed on a flex PCB from Oshpark, and a NFC chip that I got by melting down
        one of my credit cards in acetone.<br>
        Outside of the watch, the NFC chip and custom antenna worked like a charm!! However, I get
        too much parasitic capacitance or other interference when nestled in the digital watch case.
        I'll need to figure this out to solve it and call it done.

      A road bike is to a mountain bike, as a skateboard is to a mountainboard. Their height of popularity
      was in the early 2000's along with the X-games. Some compare it to the sensation of snowboarding,
      but like most analogies it's a little bit of a stretch.<br>
      This was a major project where I learned about good battery design, some machining skills, and a
      lot of patience.

        Wanting to make another watch after finishing the nixie tube watch, I decided to try working with
        some <a href="https://www.industrialalchemy.org/articleview.php?item=750" target="_blank">retro dot matrix displays</a>.
        These are REALLY neat to look at if you can get your hands on them. They're very early gallium-phosphate
        LEDs; the only application I've seen them used in are for commercial airplane cockpit displays. Because
        these were used in avionics, they are ceramic case-bodies and the top layer is sapphire. I was able to
        write <a href="https://github.com/blakewilliams1/dot-matrix-watch-2" target="_blank">these display drivers</a> for it
        based on <a href="http://www.datasheetspdf.com/pdf-down/H/D/S/HDSP2000_Hewlett-Packard.pdf" target="_blank">these xerox scans</a>
        of old datasheets from the 1970's.

        This was one of my first exposures to hardware design beyond simple arduino proto boards that
        drove small motors or read from simple sensors. I heavily based my schematic off of an existing
        one I found online by <a href="http://www.cathodecorner.com/nixiewatch/firmware/firmware.html" target="_blank">David Forbes</a>.
        The main difference is that mine uses four IN-17 nixie tubes instead of just two B5870L tubes.
        I accounted for this doubling of tubes by swapping out his PIC18LF22SS with an atmega324pb, which
        has around 30-ish GPIO pins. I directly drove every filament in use with a GPIO pin and a darlington
        transistor. As this was my first 'major' hardware project, I didn't want to deal with extra IC
        components like a serial to parallel shift register to complicate it any more.
