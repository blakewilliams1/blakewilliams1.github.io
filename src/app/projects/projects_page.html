    An old wall of flip dots at work fell into disrepair, and the panels were being parted out.
    I was able to snag a few of them and recreate the wall in a miniature version! It even uses
    a depth camera to show your silhouette in real time as you move in front of it like the original.

    I rode my motorcycle from the SF Bay Area up the California coast, Orgeon coast, Washington
    coast, took a ferry to Vancouver island, took another ferry back to Prince Rupert BC, rode to
    the Yukon, then rode the Dempster Highway to the town of Tuktoyaktuk, NWT Canada to see the

    I rode my motorcycle long the original overland trail that is the Pony Express, from Sacramento to
    Salt Lake City Utah. This covered ~700 miles of dirt road and many stops along the way at historic
    stations used by the original Pony Express business.

    The altimeter is a must have instrument every time you go skydiving, so why not make it cool?
    I savaged several <a href="https://www.industrialalchemy.org/storearticleview.php?item=113" target="_blank">KW-105AL diplays</a>
    from avionics equipment an the good ol' BMP280 barometer to make an altimeter with.<br>
    Finding even 4 of these displays <i>anywhere</i> online literally took months of scouring.

    <mat-card-title>Smart Pay Casio Watch</mat-card-title>

  <p>
    I like the tap-to-pay features of smart watches, but don't want a fully featured smart watch
    that needs to be recharged every single day to work. Now that contactless payment via NFC
    chips is much more common, I wanted to make my own ultra lightweight contactless payment watch.
    I attempted to make it with favorite cheap digital watch - the Casio A168WEM, a custom NFC
    antenna I had printed on a flex PCB from Oshpark, and a NFC chip that I got by melting down
    one of my credit cards in acetone.<br>
    Outside of the watch, the NFC chip and custom antenna worked like a charm!! However, I get
    too much parasitic capacitance or other inteference when nestled in the digital watch case.
    I'll need to figure this out to solve it and call it done.

    A road bike is to a mounntain bike, as a skateboard is to a mountainboard. Their height of popularity
    was in the early 2000's along with the X-games. Some compare it to the sensation of snowboarding,
    but like most analogies it's a little bit of a stetch.<br>
    This was a major project where I learned about good battery design, some machining skills, and a
    lot of patience.

    Wanting to make another watch after finishing the nixie tube watch, I decided to try working with
    some <a href="https://www.industrialalchemy.org/articleview.php?item=750" target="_blank">retro dot matrix dipslays</a>.
    These are REALLY neet to look at if you can get your hands on them. They're very early gallium-phosphate
    LEDS; the only application I've seen them used in are for commercial airplane cockpit displays. Because
    these were used in avionics, they are ceramic case-bodies and the top layer is saphire. I was able to
    write <a href="https://github.com/blakewilliams1/dot-matrix-watch-2" target="_blank">these display drivers</a> for it
    based on <a href="http://www.datasheetspdf.com/pdf-down/H/D/S/HDSP2000_Hewlett-Packard.pdf" target="_blank">these xerox scans</a>
    of old datasheets from the 1970's.

  <p>
    This was one of my first exposures to hardware design beyond simple arudino proto boards that
    drove small motors or read from simple sensors. I heavily based my schematic off of an existing
    one I found online by <a href="http://www.cathodecorner.com/nixiewatch/firmware/firmware.html" target="_blank">David Forbes</a>.
    The main difference is that mine uses four IN-17 nixie tubes instead of just two B5870L tubes.
    I accounted for this doubling of tubes by swapping out his PIC18LF22SS with an atmega324pb, which
    has around 30-ish GPIO pins. I directly drove every filament in use with a GPIO pin and a darlington
    transistor. As this was my first 'major' hardware project, I didn't want to deal with extra IC
    components like a serial to parallel shift register to complicate it any more.
