  <h2>Foreward</h2>
  <p>
    I've had the idea of climbing Mount Shasta and snowboarding back down for about 2 and a half years when I saw
    the mountaineering route topographic maps in the bathroom of
    <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/q8dLbFUxxyZ9SZ51A">The Fifth Season</a> gear rental in Shasta. I wanted to do it last
    year, but the snow dried up too quick and my friend had a knee problem so I waited for the next
    season. We'd been getting ready for the trip this year but unfortunately the friend that would join me got cold
    feet and backed out a day and a half before.<br><br>

    I had a hard think about whether or not I should do this trip alone, but ultimately decided to go for it. The
    distance and elevation would be challenging but
    still doable, the trail is heavily trafficked so there's always people within eyesight, and I set hard limits about
    physical exertion, weather, and overall time on trail for myself before driving to Shasta. At the end of the day you
    need to be the change you want to see in the world.

  <h2>Day 1</h2>
  <p>
    After getting to the trailhead I loaded up the gear onto my back and hit the trail but was
    nervous starting because it was so heavy. I've never carried this much stuff on a solo trip, nor this heavy of gear.
    The pack was pushing 60-65lbs and this hike was brutally steep. I came incredibly close to leaving my snowboard and related
    gear at the car fearing I wouldn't be able to summit with this much weight on my back. I tried it on and just kept
    telling myself there is no shame in stashing your gear off trail if you get too far into the hike and change your
    mind. The trail starts with fairly shallow trails in the trees leading up to a stone cabin.

    The cabin supposedly is
    right about where things open up and the trees lesson, but neither myself nor the people I was walking in the
    vicinity of could find it either. I made it about an hour into the hike before the trail got to steep and I needed
    to put on crampons. I stopped to do this and got my first real good view of Shasta valley behind me.
    <img loading="lazy" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ynHjIADC_kGpwkGzdWJoHRy84uiQfMSI" />
    This is by far
    the most I've ever used crampons, and there an absolute godsend for snow on hills. I kept trudging uphill, the
    weight of my pack still on my mind but also optimistic about how close lake Helen seem to be. I got a few more good
    shots of the valley as I went up, and you can see the hill becoming steeper now. At a certain point, you are just
    climbing stairs. The repeated use of crampons will dig out small holes and you can push your foot into those holes
    like a stair step to step upwards. It felt like doing stair climbers the last 1300 ft elevation gain to
    like Helen with incredibly heavy pack on my back. The very last stretch to the lake was by far the steepest so far.
    Lake Helen is at 9k ft, I woke up this morning at 3k ft, and was at sea level
    the day before. The last push the Helen Lake was
    really slow,
    you might only walk 20 steps at a time before giving yourself a quick rest to keep heart rate in check. Eventually you do get to there and feel super
    accomplished. About a dozen other groups are here, some are setting up tents for an early ascent
    tomorrow, some are sliding down the hill in front of us on their return from the summit, and a select few are riding
    snowboards and skis back down that same glissade path.

    Leaving all the heavy gear I'm not taking to summit is really
    boosting my confidence for tomorrow. After setting up my tent and melting multiple rounds of snow in my cookware, I
    realize one reason why my pack is so heavy. The Fifth Season gave me a three-person tent, and I didn't bother checking
    before hitting the trail! It definitely felt heavy when I got it, but I just figured that was the nature of snow
    season tents; I've only ever owned 3-season tents. Because my hiking partner bailed on me two days before, I was
    resigned to carry almost double gear weight, but now seeing the apartment sized three-person tent, I knew I was
    literally carrying double right now. If everything went as planned it didn't have to be nearly this hard, but at
    least I'm able to do it. Final task before bed is repacking my backpack for summit attempt tomorrow. It's basically
    20% the starting weight now, feeling confident.

  <h2>Day 2</h2>I woke up at 4am, and after rolling off my sleeping pad I realized they were puddles of water
  around me. Half of my Camelback leaked into the tent and some of my gear was soaked. Luckily the wet
  things weren't needed for summit attempt and could be left out to dry, but I now needed to reboil water at 4a.m. when I was supposed to be
  hitting the trail. I was already behind everyone else because I was snowboarding back down and didn't need to plan as much time for return.

  Overall it was an hour setback to fix everything and gear back up, but luckily it put me right at the
  same departure time as the only other ski campers at lake Helen; a couple from San Francisco. We all headed up Avalanche Gultch together and It's steepness
  was impressive, sometimes pushing upwards of 32Â°.

  When the others started slowing down I continued on the last bit
  ahead of them. The sun was getting higher and I wanted to take out my face coverings soon.
  It was only 3/4 of a mile but took us about 3 hours to do. We all dropped our gear at the top of Avalanche Gulch
  because the snow wasn't great past there on upper mountain. They needed extra time to recoup, and a bit more than I
  could spend so I headed on, walking on the glacier behind Red Banks.

  After that it was a push up Misery Hill, still shrouded in wispy light fog.
  <img loading="lazy" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1zIdOb3u0BBl1CydD4KdVaz6gZBQrlPqe" />
  Cresting over Misery Hill gave the first sign of the summit!
  <img loading="lazy" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1zWuoMN0uXnIQUPtAThorjQ0zg0iNPeZ8" />
  It was just a light push over a
  flat saddle and a small switchback to the peak.
  Actually reaching the peak was amazing. The accomplishment really set in and I made sure to sign the logbook.

  The clouds hung around but
  would give way and show glimpses up to 100 mi away. Coming back down was a breeze. I stopped at my snowboard at the
  top of Red Banks to eat some food before writing down, but then I heard lightning off in the distance. There was a
  storm moving in from about 50 miles away and time to get off the mountain. The storm wasn't supposed to come in until
  that evening, but it was earlier than what the weather reports and rangers on mountain were expecting. Riding down on
  the snowboard was awesome! I was nervous at first, being the first skier or snowboarder to summit but also the first
  one down the gulch again.

  The conditions were great, the snow had softened, and I got down within 15 minutes back to Lake Helen. Lots of people
  sliding glissading down were filming, would be nice to get those videos somehow.

  Back at camp I packed everything up, and headed down to car. Riding the rest of the way down wasn't quite as enjoyable,
  all the snow downhill from there was moderately
  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sun-cupped+snow&tbm=isch">sun-cupped</a> and you're riding over these craters
  similar to golf ball dimpling, but the dimples were about the size of dinner plates and about 6 to 8 in deep. With all
  the added weight on my back it was hard to ride well over the bad terrain, and I walked the last half mile after
  hitting the tree line. When I got back to the gear outfitters, they said someone radioed that my axe fell out of my
  pack on the way back. They said they wouldn't fine me for late/lost gear so I didn't bring up the tent size issue.<br><br>

  Overall it was a phenominal and exhausting time, 10/10.
