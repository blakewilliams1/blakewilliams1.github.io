      I was able to acquire four KW-105AL displays. These are so incredibly difficult to find online. The only easy
      place I could find them were a few niche aerospace parts vendors; the kind where there are no prices, only email
      contact for salesmen. I was getting quoted 500-1200$ USD, EACH. They sell for $25-50 USD each from any other
      sources.

      First breadboarding attempts to use all major components together. The BMP280 barometer and LSM303 IMU work as
      expected, but getting the displays to drive is proving to be a challenge. The only compact way I can think of
      connecting to the displays involve permanently soldering them to the board, so that's not going to happen until
      the very end. You have to press them into the vias on the board which isn't very reliable so I'll make some faux
      16 segment display for testing I can use to prove it's functionality.

      The actual displays were incredibly difficult to get to work without soldering to their test boards; I would
      need to twist them in their sockets to have all the pins make proper contact, and that wasn't even very reliable
      either. I decided to make another test board to verify the LED drivers were being sent data correctly using
      through hole LEDs, where each LED represents one of the 16 segments no need to test with the actual filament
      displays now!

      Eventually I got the LED driver ICs working correctly and got first successful tests done with the real displays!
      Here is almost all of them turned on simultaneously to test the wattage load.

      Unfortunately this is where the project has been left off, it got stuck at the integration of the LED driver ICs
      but the rest of the project should be relatively straightforward once this is solved. In terms of firmware, there
      is little left to do.
