  <h1 style="text-align: center">What it takes to make a fursuit</h1>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <p>How hard could it be? Well, the answer really depends on whether or not you hit burnout, and how hard it hits you.</p>

  <p>It'll make more sense to explain the process categorically by individual pieces rather than chronologically.
  Feel free to scroll down or click to specific sections of interest.</p>

    <h2>Head</h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    I started with a 3d printed head-base that I bought from an established maker named
    <a href="https://www.mixedcandycostumes.com/">MixedCandy</a>, off of their etsy page they sold a
    base with the expression "grumpy K9". Onto this I added several layers of masking tape in alternating grain
    direction and drew on the pattern where color boundaries would be, along with more annotations to help with
    cutting and keeping track of how the pieces align after they're off the head. We'll use these pieces as a
    pattern to cut fur later.
  </p>

  <p>
    I had a personal goal of designing the interior to be completely removable everywhere that my head physically
    touched for easier cleaning. I used quarter-sized disk magnets on the inside of the base, paired with matching
    magnets inside of spandex covered foam "cups" that wrap around the sides and back of your head. Also, I added a
    thin removable chin rest. This is what it looks like on the inside.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don't have many progress pics of hand sewing the fur mask together but this is the way it looked before putting
    it onto the base. I felt I had to hand sew it to get a <i>very</i> small seam that wouldn't bulge and deform
    against the base. Kinda Silence of the Lambs vibes, right?
  </p>
  <img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.google.com/u/0/d/1icVbM01Tn5doj1jK7CBU-6us10gUDXXL" />
  <p>
    After almost 3 weeks of hand-sewing the mask for 2-5 hours a day, I finally finished the face and neck. This was
    the first time seeing it "properly" stretched over the base it was made for.
  </p>
  <img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.google.com/u/0/d/1iMh-aFOTPsy0_fScsNljvlHvc-H_eP3o" />
  <p>
    This is what it would look like "improperly" stretched over the base, but with the eyes, teeth, hair, and foam base
    ears in place to get an idea of how progress is going and the visual direction it's headed in.
  </p>
  <img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.google.com/u/0/d/1iTAiyVe_wwxSdCrDyBbP5SiqGliCm10c" />
  <p>
    Once the face is sewn together, baseball stitching in the ears is next. The inner ear is just black felt to give a
    sense of depth and the foam lobes are wrapped in more fur which is hot glued on. After the ears are in place, I added
    select areas of thin 1/4" foam to the interior of the fur mask. I felt this would help keep things looking rounded
    and plump; there wouldn't be any chance for loose fur to be wrinkled in these areas and it helped reduce visibility
    of seams. The entire fur mask is ready for permanent affixation to the base!
  </p>
  <img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.google.com/u/0/d/1icXbNWwDfQC76vBW87k1zHEGGfNR67FH" />
  <p>
    This was another novel thing I tried out in my build process: I wanted to REALLY be sure that the fur would never
    come unglued in a few critical points along the face; if they did, there would be no way to fix it once the fabric
    fusion glue dries. These are places like concave dimples, the underside of cheeks, the furled eyebrow/nose bridge,
    etc.. Anywhere with significant concave curves. My idea was to drill very small holes in those spots, stretch the
    fur mask over the base, then push sewing needles through the holes and mask to create a loop of threading. I would
    tie the threading off with a lot of slack in the loops like this:
  </p>
  <img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.google.com/u/0/d/1idBDiQQnzu3SvDNneh_cpMebHKKFOraD" />
  <p>
    I wanted not only to make permanent physical anchors holding these key spots in place, but also help dramatically
    speed up my working time while glueing the mask to the base. I opted for fabric fusion after weighing a few options
    because it was a clear permanent fabric glue with a "long" working time of ~ 30 minutes which still felt like very
    little time.
  </p>
  <p>
    By "pre-stretching" the mask over the base to add these thread loop anchors, I was able to grab all of them
    from the back and pull them tight one action, then tie them off so the base was held still in the correct way while
    it dried over a full day. It added an extra few hours of prep work to try this technique but I'm really happy with
    how well it worked in the end.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is what it looked like after fully applying the glue! The masking tape is wrapping around all un-sewn edges and
    into the interior to hold the fur tight against the base.

  <p>
    The mohawk is a long triangular strip of foam with 2 strips of red fur sewn together and glued to it. That mohawk
    was then baseball stitched into the fur head and down along the back of the neck. The baseball stitching is
    surprisingly loose and spread out; you can wiggle your finger through it from one side to the other but it worked
    really well and you'd never know.

    <h2>Hands</h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    I followed a pattern for the hand-paws I found online and I'm really pleased with how they came out. It's not
    perfectly the way I'd want it to look but it's good and to instantly have access to a good pattern is hard to come
    by. I started by creating all the claws out of stretchy black velvet/velour material, stuffing them with polyfil,
    then sewing them into the tops of each finger. They're inserted into a dart in the fabric then it's all sewn shut.
  </p>
  <img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.google.com/u/0/d/1hlLYP_Fd436Pze2pkGOWYPA1lbdhc50O" />
  <p>
    For the pads beneath claws, I taped and pinned the template guide into the backside of the fabric then sewed all
    the pads in one go with a single large sheet of velour then cut the unneeded velour away as close to the stitching
    as I could. This created empty pads on the fur side of the fabric, and I cut small openings into the fur which
    polyfil could be stuffed in and then sewn shut again. This creates large plushy pads, aka beans.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once top and bottom halves were finished, it was time to painstakingly sew them together (<b>very</b> hard to feed
    the fabric in at webbing of fingers). then flip them inside out to see the finished result

    <h2>Bodysuit</h2>
  </div>
  <p>
    Unless you're a tailor, the most straight-forward way to get super accurate pattern of your body is to make a duct
    tape dummy. There are tons of videos online showing how to do this and it's a several person job. You basically
    wear a cheap and thin painter suit while others wrap you in 2 layers of duct tape then cut you out of it. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I built up a skin-tight masking tape layer around the dummy that I can use to draw on without worrying that I'm
    affecting the dummy itself (in case revisions need to be done). 
  </p>
  <img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.google.com/u/0/d/1hB9yE3gn14VV3WBUPuwr6ozUPj9_UN_N" />
  <p>
    Once I finished drawing my pattern onto the dummies masking tape shell, I cut it off and used the shapes as
    patterns for cutting the fur. There are tons of videos online explaining this process. For my first bodysuit I
    decided to make it plantigrade (no special padding)
  </p>
  <img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.google.com/u/0/d/1hSwGnwUpbYWFdfAK36R3RgRE3wuQKCHH" />
  <p>
    Once all pieces were cut out (several days of effort) I double checked they were all there by laying them out.
  </p>

  <img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.google.com/u/0/d/1hlRn0Rb9PiiaI0mIVBoU-6hfg02NRXhj" />
  <p>
    I decided to sew it up in left and right halves independently which helped make the amount of material you're
    working with at any moment much more manageable. I added a zipper down the middle front and I followed
    <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/684815037/premium-tutorial-deluxe-zipper-technique">this AMAZING deluxe zipper guide</a>.

  <div id="feet" class="section-header">
    <h2>Feet</h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    The feet start as a pair of cheap crocs from Walmart, which are then glued with e6000 to eva foam mats. The mats are
    cut out to the general footprint shape desired, an thick 1" foam is glued into the shape of toes. I followed a
    pattern for the first pair I made and they were WAAAYY to big. I ditched the pattern and free-handed the footprint
    to be as small as I could make it to still fit the shoes then re-did the foam toes in the same way as before, but
    smaller this time.
  </p>
  <img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.google.com/u/0/d/1hIF5p7vxfDE8LcK8EZqACYqFgwsSjJzr" />
  <p>
    Once the overall shape felt good enough, I added some stiff foam around the back of the heels then masking taped up
    one of the feet to get a fur pattern for it.
  </p>
  <img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.google.com/u/0/d/1hZFnxe1kZ67B_bGCilIGz9CT2p9ppbnr" />
  <p>
    I cut out the fur based on the pattern, sewed it into a "cover" for each foot (doing a mirrored pattern for the
    other foot), then glued it all down with hot glue and e6000.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not pictured yet is the rubber threading I added to the underside of the feet. I didn't realize how insanely
    slippery the feet are on wet surfaces till I walked on one and nearly fell. It's no joke how slippery the feet were
    on smooth wet floors.

  <div id="tail" class="section-header">
    <h2>Tail</h2>
  </div>

  <p>I don't have many progress pics of the tail, but I tried to make it like
    <a href="https://youtu.be/vFkfsAU17KQ?si=RiKJdsrz2trMiFHL&t=96">a "super motion" tail</a>. I don't think I did a
    bad job but I think it would be a lot better. I tried multiple times to get the tail motion right but whenever
    the fur is applied it becomes too stiff and doesn't wag correctly. This is what it looks
    like as the end result:

    I'm very happy with how it came out! For a first attempt at making a suit, I think it turned out <i>especially</i>
    well. Here are a few pics I had taken of me in it at FC and LVFC!
