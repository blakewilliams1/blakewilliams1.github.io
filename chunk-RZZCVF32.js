Travelers headed south from Dakhla all say they hear West Saharan locals say things like "welcome to Morocco" even though the official UN recognized border is hundreds of miles north. Moroccan flags fly throughout basically all towns now and the government of Morocco is doing a lot to win favor in the region. Western Saharans don't pay any Moroccan taxes but Morocco has heavily improved the region's infrastructure, public services, and general quality of life. If you look at the border of Mauritania and Western Sahara on Google Maps you'll see it's solid, but the line in the north that divides it from Morocco, it's much more faint and only dashed.
