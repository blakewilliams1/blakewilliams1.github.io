# Personal site

An angular static site to host my personal website, show my projects, and other misc things

## Development

Locally run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run 'ng deploy' to push prod changes to github and make sure to reset custom URL mapping after each prod push. gh-pages-cli tool provides the 'ng deploy' tooling.
