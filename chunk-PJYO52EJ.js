As interesting as glass blowing would be, the facilities and time to do this is a bit out of reach at the moment. I learned that it's now possible to buy LED stripping that's wrapped in diffuser tubing of a high enough quality that you don't see the individual LED elements, and it mimics the effects of a glass tube of neon. I bought some of these strips and began converting the art to an equivalent design more fitted to this medium.
