A mountain bike is to a road bicycle as a mountainboard is to a skateboard. I first learned about mountainboards from this youtube video I was linked to while watching snowboarding videos: "),i(),a(9,"youtube-placeholder",1),e(10,"p"),t(11," It was immediately interesting to me, but when first discovering this around 2018 it was such a niche market that pretty much all electric variants were custom made by builders online, or by one of 2 companies charging 3-5 grand per board. I decided to make one myself as well, and started with this base mountainboard; It's a Trampa HS11 deck with MBS trucks, foot bindings, and wheels. "),i(),a(12,"img",2),e(13,"p",3),t(14," The first major hurdle was making the battery pack. Here I am spot welding Samsung 30Q 18650 batteries together into parallel groups, for use in a 12 series 6 parallel battery configuration. "),i(),a(15,"img",4),e(16,"p"),t(17," All parallel groups put into a pelican case for test fitting. The extra space at the front will be used for a battery management system for balanced recharging. "),i(),a(18,"img",5),e(19,"p"),t(20," I made each series connection out of 4 lines of flat braided tinned copper wire. Each of the lines are rated up to 40A continuous, so since I want my pack to be able to discharge up to 100A continuous I made these internal connections rated up to 160A for extra safety. There is at least 2 layers of kapton tape between each of the parallel groups as well as the entire exterior of the battery coated in it as well. "),i(),a(21,"img",6),e(22,"p"),t(23," Here is the full assembly put into the pelican case, with charge ports installed and connected to the balance charger. This was the first charge test to verify the pack would charge correctly and it was really nerve-wracking; if it went wrong it could have been a MASSIVE battery fire. "),i(),a(24,"img",7),e(25,"p"),t(26," Here are some 3d printed holders for xt 90 connectors. I drilled some holes in the pelican case to make room for them. They act as power switches for the board.

The battery and ESC are mounted to the deck as well as the motors mounted to the rear trucks.

Nearly all Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs) run on open source firmware called Vedder ESC, and it comes with a desktop application to calibrate your controllers to your specific hardware setup. "),i(),a(35,"img",11),e(36,"p"),t(37," I 3D printed some 72 teeth gears to mount to the wheel hubs.

Because the gears are so close and have drastically different tooth counts, the motor pulleys only ever have 3-4 teeth in mesh. Asphalt handles fine but higher torque needs like off-road and deep gravel struggle with belt skip. At this point I begin to look into adding an idler pulley "),i(),a(44,"img",15),e(45,"p"),t(46," This was second sign that my drivetrain needs a re-work. Besides belt skipping, 3d printed gears are just not strong enough for the job. Layer separation would occur if the gears took any non-trivial impact.

"),i(),a(47,"img",16),e(48,"p"),t(49," The third and final sign that the rubber belts weren't going to cut it anymore for the project. Too much torque, too much belt skips, too brittle parts for what I need. The torque after only about 20 miles begin to cause the internal fibers of the belts to tear. This is when I begin to replace the belts with chain. "),i(),a(50,"img",17),e(51,"p",18),t(52," I bought some 66 tooth sprockets and 25H roller chain.

Sometimes building things is more rewarding than actually using them, but this was definitely an exception to that; It's one of my favorite things to use that I've made!
