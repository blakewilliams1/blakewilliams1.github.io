I've never carried this much stuff on a solo trip, nor this heavy of gear. The pack was pushing 60-65lbs and this hike was brutally steep. I came incredibly close to leaving my snowboard and related gear at the car fearing I wouldn't be able to summit with this much weight on my back. I tried it on and just kept telling myself there is no shame in stashing your gear off trail if you get too far into the hike and change your mind.

"),o.Mb(26,"img",7),o.lc(27," The cabin supposedly is right about where things open up and the trees lesson, but neither myself nor the people I was walking in the vicinity of could find it either.

"),o.Mb(28,"img",8),o.lc(29," This is by far the most I've ever used crampons, and there an absolute godsend for snow on hills. I kept trudging uphill, the weight of my pack still on my mind but also optimistic about how close lake Helen seem to be. I got a few more good shots of the valley as I went up, and you can see the hill becoming steeper now. At a certain point, you are just climbing stairs. The repeated use of crampons will dig out small holes and you can push your foot into those holes like a stair step to step upwards. It felt like doing stair climbers the last 1300 ft elevation gain to like Helen with incredibly heavy pack on my back. The very last stretch to the lake was by far the steepest so far. Lake Helen is at 9k ft, I woke up this morning at 3k ft, and was at sea level the day before. The last push the Helen Lake was really slow, you might only walk 20 steps at a time before giving yourself a quick rest to keep heart rate in check. Eventually you do get to there and feel super accomplished. About a dozen other groups are here, some are setting up tents for an early ascent tomorrow, some are sliding down the hill in front of us on their return from the summit, and a select few are riding snowboards and skis back down that same glissade path.

After setting up my tent and melting multiple rounds of snow in my cookware, I realize one reason why my pack is so heavy. The Fifth Season gave me a three-person tent, and I didn't bother checking before hitting the trail! It definitely felt heavy when I got it, but I just figured that was the nature of snow season tents; I was literally carrying double weight right now. Final task before bed is repacking my backpack for summit attempt tomorrow. It's basically 20% the starting weight now, feeling confident.

Coming back down was a breeze. I stopped at my snowboard at the top of Red Banks to eat some food before writing down, but then I heard lightning off in the distance. There was a storm moving in from about 50 miles away and time to get off the mountain. The storm wasn't supposed to come in until that evening, but it was earlier than what the weather reports and rangers on mountain were expecting. Riding down on the snowboard was awesome!
