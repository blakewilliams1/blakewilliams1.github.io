Beyond telling the standard time of day, it also tracked various other things such as a seasonal dial to let the farmers know when to harvest or plant their crops as well as a dial telling Bohemian Time. Bohemian time is an antiquated system where there were still 24 hours in a day, but the time was only tracked when the sun was up; the start of hour one was sunrise, and the end of hour 24 was sunset.
