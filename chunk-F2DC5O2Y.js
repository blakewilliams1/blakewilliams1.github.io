Port Artisanal is a short 2km walk from the Auberge Sahara, it's an old school fisherman's harbor that seems to have outgrown its size. If you look at Port Artisanal from Google Earth you see the extent of overcrowded fishing boats in the water. Here's what it looks like on the ground. `);

If I had another week I would've crossed the DMZ border north into there to see it.

Whatever ground the rebel group used to have is basically all gone and the entire region is more or less part of Morocco now. All Mauritanians ask "are you going to Morocco?" And mean literally everything above their border. Travelers headed south from Dakhla all say they hear West Saharan locals say things like "welcome to Morocco" even though the official UN recognized border is hundreds of miles north. Moroccan flags fly throughout basically all towns now and the government of Morocco is doing a lot to win favor in the region. Western Saharans don't pay any Moroccan taxes but Morocco has heavily improved the region's infrastructure, public services, and general quality of life. If you look at the border of Mauritania and Western Sahara on Google Maps you'll see it's solid, but the line in the north that divides it from Morocco, it's much more faint and only dashed. Looking it up after returning, it seems like the UN takes a stance that western sahara should have right to sovereignty, but right now I highly doubt that will happen (not to say this is good or bad). `);

Sorry dude, there is not a single question in the world I know that you would be asking me unless it's about myself. It may have been genuine, but in the moment it kind of felt like a strategy to close a physical distance gap and even if it wasn't I was so close to successfully finishing my trip I didn't want to find out. After another two blocks I saw a rock violently bounced across the ground in front of me coming from the right. When I looked over to its origin I saw a group of seven or so teenagers across the road picking up a few more rocks to to throw. I sped walk around a corner before more came, and immediately pulled my head wrap and sunglasses out of my bag. After I put that on and got out of the area, I was able to walk the remaining mile and a half to the airport with zero issues. I was worried Mauritanian Airlines would be late because I heard stories about other domestic African airlines not being timely, but luckily that wasn't the case. ");
