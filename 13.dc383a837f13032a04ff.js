Even still, the walls are filled to the brim with stapled on letters addressed to the deceased, memorial posters, sharpie-d notes onto the walls, and sentimental memorabilia. Groups of people sit in silence together in the alcoves and central room in silence, many silently crying. The structure is designed to be burned down the day after the man burns, as a cathartic release. I felt conflicted being in the temple; I had no grief in my heart that merited release.
