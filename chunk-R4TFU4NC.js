I've never carried this much stuff on a solo trip, nor this heavy of gear. The pack was pushing 60-65lbs and this hike was brutally steep. I came incredibly close to leaving my snowboard and related gear at the car fearing I wouldn't be able to summit with this much weight on my back. I tried it on and just kept telling myself there is no shame in stashing your gear off trail if you get too far into the hike and change your mind.

I made it about an hour into the hike before the trail got too steep and I needed to put on crampons. This is by far the most I've ever used crampons, and they're an absolute godsend in the snow.

Lake Helen is at 9k ft, I woke up this morning at 3k ft, and was at sea level the day before. Eventually you do get to there and feel super accomplished. About a dozen other groups are here, some are setting up tents for an early ascent tomorrow, some are sliding down the hill in front of us on their return from the summit, and a select few are riding snowboards and skis back down that same glissade path. "),t(27,"img",4)(28,"br"),e(29," Leaving all the heavy gear I'm not taking to summit is really boosting my confidence for tomorrow. After setting up my tent and melting multiple rounds of snow in my cookware, I realize one reason why my pack is so heavy. The Fifth Season gave me a three-person tent, and I didn't bother checking before hitting the trail! It definitely felt heavy when I got it, but I just figured that was the nature of snow season tents; I was literally carrying double weight right now.

Luckily the wet things weren't needed for summit attempt and could be left out to dry, but I now needed to reboil water at 4am when I was supposed to be hitting the trail.

There was a storm moving in from about 50 miles away and time to get off the mountain. The storm wasn't supposed to come in until that evening, but it was earlier than what the weather reports and rangers on mountain were expecting. Riding down on the snowboard was awesome!
