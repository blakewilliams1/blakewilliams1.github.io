As you approach it, the crowds energy completely changes and everything becomes silent and pensive. The air practically weighs heavily in your lungs with how somber the mood is inside. The central room is surrounded by a circular ring-shaped pathway with numerous alcoves to maximize the surface area on the walls. Even still, the walls are filled to the brim with stapled on letters addressed to the deceased, memorial posters, sharpie-d notes onto the walls, and sentimental memorabilia. Groups of people sit in silence together in the alcoves and central room in silence, many silently crying. The structure is designed to be burned down the day after the man burns, as a cathartic release. I felt conflicted being in the temple; I had no grief in my heart that merited release.

I set me clothes on the ground, but completely lost track of them by the time I was ready to get dressed again and wandered naked for 15 minutes through the hundreds of side lined crowd looking for my clothes pile.
