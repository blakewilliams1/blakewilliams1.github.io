Unlike a vast majority of QR codes that will direct you to some fixed URL, this code is 'dynamic'. This means that I can change it's functionality as I please. I created a custom android app that for this! On my phone I select from a pre-set list of abilities I've written accounted for, then behind the scenes I call Github's REST API to commit the changes to a JSON file stored on GitHub. For example, the landing page can redirect to any other URL of my choosing, prompt a download for a VCF contact file, open a chat with me on whatsapp/telegram/twitter/etc... and many more. The QR code landing page reads the config file and then determines what info to show or where to redirect users to from there.
