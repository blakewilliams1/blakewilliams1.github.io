Landing and walking off the plane, you're hit with a much more humid air than you'd expect. The capital city is on the coast and you can feel it for sure. Visa processing is very standard, but the people out here treat lines very strangely. People will literally walk in front of you if you do not actively block or stop them from doing so. This happened on multiple occasions, in multiple lines. When we landed it was still night time. Walking out past security with my visa, I went to the nearest ATM I found to withdraw more money, just in case lo and behold the machine gave me error messages. I had literally called my bank twice for for travel warning and reassurance this wouldn't happen. Both times they assured me there will be no issues. Thank God I brought emergency US dollars stashed in my pack just in case. Walking out of the airport, it really hit me how much of a fish out of water I was.

In the sure taxi was someone from the minibus, two women in head to toe coverings except for eyes. They had massive amounts of rice, water, and general supplies.

They were asking a lot for it, and, haggling only got a change in currencies but not the overall value down. By the time I bought it, there were four other women that had walked in and sat in the door away, all bringing small bowls filled with their own souvenirs ushering me to buy them.

We hurried up to catch and sure enough all of our gear was there mounted to the camels already. We said hellos while continued to walk. His name is Salima, and would be responsible for leading the camels and loading/unloading cargo on them. The first couple hours were filled with dunes and some flat sections of what looked to be dried seafloor. We stopped around 2pm for a break to beat the heat of the day and had lunch under a big tree.

We crossed a few more ridgelines but this time there was some plant life! The dunes climbed just as high but on more shallow grade and speckled with these spiky Saharan grass plants. After a couple hours of walking through this we came across a nomad family in their large tent structure. Werating.
