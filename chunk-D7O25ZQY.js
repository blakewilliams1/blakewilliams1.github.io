Onto this I added several layers of masking tape in alternating grain direction and drew on the pattern where color boundaries would be, along with more annotations to help with cutting and keeping track of how the pieces align after they're off the head. We'll use these pieces as a pattern to cut fur later. `),t(),a(41,"img",9),i(42,"p"),e(43,' I had a personal goal of designing the interior to be completely removable everywhere that my head physically touched for easier cleaning.

The inner ear is just black felt to give a sense of depth and the foam lobes are wrapped in more fur which is hot glued on. After the ears are in place, I added select areas of thin 1/4" foam to the interior of the fur mask. I felt this would help keep things looking rounded and plump; there wouldn't be any chance for loose fur to be wrinkled in these areas and it helped reduce visibility of seams.

These are places like dimples, the underside of cheeks, the furled eyebrow/nose bridge, etc.. Anywhere with significant concave curves. I drilled very small holes in those spots, stretched the fur mask over the base, then pushed sewing needles through the holes and mask to create a loop of thread.
